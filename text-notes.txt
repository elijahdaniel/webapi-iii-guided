Middleware
    - Build-in are methods that are packaged as part of express
        - server.use(express.json())
    - Custom is middleware that we write
        - (req, res) function
    - Third-party is installed with Yarn/NPM to add functionality to our application
        - 

Postman
    - Headers
        - X-Powered-By
            - Not good to show what you're using. Could lead to attack vector - Dig up server and find weaknesses that they can exploit
                - Third party middleware to make your application more secure: yarn add helmet
                - Import it const helmet = require('helmet')
                - server.use(helmet())
